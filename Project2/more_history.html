      <span id = "desc_gill"> Gill Sans was created in 1926, but the roots can be traced back to the typeface that Gill’s teacher Edward Johnston designed for London Underground Railway in 1913. Eric Gill was not fully satisfied with Johnston Sans, he wanted to create a typeface that is perfect legible. Taking inspiration from Johnston’s work, Gill first experimented with his improved in 1926 when he hand painted some lettering for a bookshop sign. Noticed by Stanley Morison of Monotype company for its commercial potential, Eric Gill was given the job to design a font that could be the British counterpart to Futura. The font was then released by Monotype in 1928 as Gill Sans. In the year following its release, it was chose to be the font for the London and North Eastern Railways and, and later British Railway. More recently, the BBC began to use Gill Sans in their logo in 1997.</span>
